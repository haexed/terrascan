## Application Materials

### Project Summary (Reusable)

```
Terrascan is an open-source real-time environmental monitoring platform
that aggregates data from NASA, NOAA, World Air Quality Index, and GBIF
into a single, trusted interface. Built with a "real data or no data"
philosophy, we combat environmental misinformation by showing only
verified measurements.

The platform is live at terrascan.io, MIT-licensed, and will remain
free forever. We need funding to ensure long-term sustainability and
prevent the project from stalling like similar "ecowatch" initiatives.
```

### Key Metrics (Update Regularly)

- **Version**: 3.2.0
- **Data Sources**: 5 (NASA FIRMS, WAQI, NOAA, GBIF, OpenWeatherMap)
- **License**: MIT
- **Production URL**: https://terrascan.io
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/haexed/terrascan

### Impact Statements

**Environmental:**
> "Terrascan democratizes access to environmental data, enabling citizens,
> educators, and journalists to make informed decisions about climate and
> environmental health."

**Technical:**
> "By aggregating 5+ data sources with intelligent caching and a regional
> scanning system, Terrascan solves the fragmentation problem that plagues
> environmental data access."

**Social:**
> "Our 'real data or no data' policy builds public trust in environmental
> information at a time when misinformation is rampant."
