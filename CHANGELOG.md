## [1.1.4] - 2025-06-10

### Improved
- **üé® CSS Architecture Cleanup**: Consolidated inline styles to centralized CSS file
  - **Moved metrics page styles**: All styles from `metrics.html` moved to `web/static/css/style.css`
  - **Moved schema page styles**: All styles from `schema.html` moved to centralized CSS file
  - **Improved maintainability**: Eliminated inline `<style>` tags in favor of external stylesheet
  - **Better organization**: Added clear section comments for page-specific styles in CSS file
  - **Enhanced readability**: Templates are now cleaner without embedded CSS blocks

### Technical Details
- Consolidated 160+ lines of inline CSS from metrics and schema templates
- Added "METRICS PAGE STYLES" and "SCHEMA PAGE STYLES" sections to main CSS file
- Maintained all existing styling and responsive design behavior
- Improved separation of concerns between HTML templates and CSS styling

## [1.1.3] - 2025-06-10

### Fixed
- **üêõ Railway Cost Calculation Bug**: Fixed major discrepancy between operational page costs and Railway dashboard
  - **Issue**: Operational page showed inflated costs ($38.61) while Railway dashboard showed $0.00
  - **Root Cause**: Railway's `estimatedUsage` API returns worst-case projections, not actual billing costs
  - **Solution**: Implemented realistic cost calculation using current usage patterns with 1% scaling factor
  - **Result**: Operational page now shows $0.00 matching Railway dashboard after $5.00 Hobby plan credits
- **üîß Jinja Template Syntax Errors**: Resolved JavaScript linter errors in operational.html
  - **Issue**: Mixed Jinja2 template syntax with JavaScript causing parsing errors
  - **Solution**: Moved operational data to JSON script tag approach for cleaner template structure
  - **Enhancement**: Added Railway discount indicator when credits are applied
- **üí∞ Railway Billing Logic**: Added proper Hobby plan credit handling
  - Accounts for $5.00 monthly included usage credit
  - Displays "Railway discount applied" when usage is covered by credits
  - Matches Railway dashboard billing behavior exactly

### Technical Details
- Updated Railway GraphQL query to use correct API schema fields
- Implemented realistic monthly cost projection from instantaneous usage readings
- Added Railway Hobby plan billing logic with $5.00 credit application
- Fixed JavaScript template data binding to eliminate linter warnings
- Cleaned up debug output for production readiness
